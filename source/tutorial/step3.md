Go to your app folder and run:
````bash
npx http-server -c0 .
````
This will serve your application at your localhost. You can now go to the [WebShell Sandbox](https://websh.org/sandbox)
and open it. Click the launcher button in top left corner, and open your app from `http://localhost:8080`

There's not much to do in our app for now, except hit the **About** button in the toolbar.

We will turn our app into a simple text editor in [step 4](step4).

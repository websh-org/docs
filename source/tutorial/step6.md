title: Step 6 - Make and publish a real app
----


To make life easier for you, we have created some [starter repos](/docs/getting-started/template-repos.html) which you can use
for building real apps. 

Read the [API docs](api/) to learn about working with multiple time formats and other things that WebShell can do for your apps.

You can publish your app anywhere you wish. If it's a frontend-only app, GitHub pages or any other static server is good enough.

When you do, please [tell us about it](https://github.com/websh-org/apps/issues/new?labels=New+App&template=new-app.md)!
